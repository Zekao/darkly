# flag6 | redirect page

On de main page, we can see on the footer that there is three buttons that redirect to facebook, twitter and instagram. We can see that the redirect is written in the front and not in the back so we can change the url to redirect to another page. 
```bash
http://192.168.56.104/index.php?page=redirect&site=pouet
```

It's problematic because it can be used as phishing attack. We can redirect to a page that look like facebook and steal the credentials.
